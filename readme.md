# Master's thesis / Dense tracking of human facial geometry

This repository contains the source code of my master's thesis project. The trained network model is also included.

The goal of this project was to explore whether it is possible to train a very deep neural network using non-realistic
rendered data to densely detect human facial geometry in real-world images.

Using training data similar to this:

Results like these were obtained:
